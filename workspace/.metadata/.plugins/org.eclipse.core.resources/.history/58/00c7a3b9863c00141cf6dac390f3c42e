/**
 * A server for a network multi-player tic tac toe game.  Modified and
 * extended from the class presented in Deitel and Deitel "Java How to
 * Program" book.  I made a bunch of enhancements and rewrote large sections
 * of the code.  The main change is instead of passing *data* between the
 * client and server, I made a TTTP (tic tac toe protocol) which is totally
 * plain text, so you can test the game with Telnet (always a good idea.)
 * The strings that are sent in TTTP are:
 *
 *  Client -> Server           Server -> Client
 *  ----------------           ----------------
 *  MOVE <n>  (0 <= n <= 8)    WELCOME <char>  (char in {X, O})
 *  QUIT                       VALID_MOVE
 *                             OTHER_PLAYER_MOVED <n>
 *                             VICTORY
 *                             DEFEAT
 *                             TIE
 *                             MESSAGE <text>
 *
 * A second change is that it allows an unlimited number of pairs of
 * players to play.
